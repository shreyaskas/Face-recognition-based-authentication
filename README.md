# Face-recognition-based-authentication
This project leverages OpenCV, Streamlit, and a KNN model for real-time face recognition-based authentication. It captures facial images, trains a lightweight KNN classifier, and provides a user-friendly Streamlit interface for secure login and attendanceâ€”ideal for low-resource, efficient systems."
